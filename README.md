>About:<br>
Some people say php is not the language to do a fulltextsearch and they are right ;-) but anyway: terraserver<span>.</span>de/search performs a realtime fulltext-search over spezified directorys including subdirectorys and returns a link and an extract of each file. htmlspecialchars are supported so a search for "über" will return documents having "\&uuml;ber" as well as documents having "über". 
>
>Changes:<br>
\- Added some more features like 'match case' and the possibility to limit the number of results.
>
>Configure:<br>
Comment/Uncomment your language configuration and if necessary edit the settings.
>
>Have fun...
