<p>About:<br>
Some people say php is not the language to do a fulltextsearch and they are right ;-) but anyway: terraserver<span>.</span>de/search performs a realtime fulltext-search over spezified directorys including subdirectorys and returns a link and an extract of each file. htmlspecialchars are supported so a search for &quot;über&quot; will return documents having &quot;&amp;uuml;ber&quot; as well as documents having &quot;über&quot;. </p>
<p>Changes:<br>
- Added some more features like &#39;match case&#39; and the possibility to limit the number of results.</p>
<p>Configure:<br>
Comment/Uncomment your language configuration and if necessary edit the settings.</p>
<p>Have fun...</p>
